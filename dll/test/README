A Simple FDF Test Program
=========================

To run the test program, set FDF_LIB to point to the location of your shared
FDF library and then type run_hello.  So you might type:

    export FDF_LIB=/tmp/libfdfdbg.so
    ./run_hello

This will ensure that libfdfdll.a is built, build the test program and then run
it.
