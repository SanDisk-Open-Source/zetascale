This directory contains the source to a utility
for post-processing an aio trace collected by
memcached.

To collect an AIO trace do the following:

- recompile the trunk with AIO_TRACE defined
in the topmost Makefile.defs.local file.
- Before you do a run, create a directory called
"AT" in the directory where you invoke memcached.
This is the directory where the aio trace files are
collected.
- Make your run.
- Rename the AT directory so it isn't clobbered the next
time you do a run.

To analyze an aio trace use the "aa" utility that is compiled
in trunk/sdf/fth/AIOTrace.  Type "aa" by itself to get the usage.
