Hotkey Manual for Schooner Memcached

This manual would introduce memcli usage of hot key for customer, including:
    1. Schooner Memcached supported hot key commands.
    2. Detail usage of each command.
    3. Snapshot viewer for history hot key.
    4. Advanced usage of hot key for configuration.


1. Schooner Memcached supported Hot key commands:
    * schooner hotkey init
    * schooner hotkey on/off
    * stats hotkey
    * stats hotclient
    * schooner hotkey reset

2. Detail usage of each command:

* schooner hotkey init

    schooner hotkey init [max_hot_keys, e.g., 300] [enable_ip_tracking] [enable_cmd_types]
    
    max_hot_keys is 10000, default is 300.
        a) if enable_ip_tracking is on, keys are sensitive with client ip, and dumped keys
        would combine with real ip, else client ip is treated as '0.0.0.0'.
        b) if enable_cmd_types is on, get/update are treated separately, and dumped keys
        are with UPDATE/GET head flag in snapshots, else get/update are merged as access
        with ACCESS head flag in snapshots.
    currently can only init once.
    
    Return OK if successful, or else return ERROR.

* schooner hotkey on/off

    By default, hotkey is off, you need turn on if you want to get hot key information.
    hotkey can be enable/disable as you want.
    
    Return OK if successful, or else return ERROR.

* stats hotkey
    stats hotkey [ntop]
    
    Return ntop most hot key of Memcached.
    ntop is the number to be shown, ntop <= max_hot_keys(10000).
   
    Result format:
        HOTKEY_UPDATE|HOTKEY_GET|HOTKEY_ACCESS
        ip ref-count key
        ...
        ip ref-count key
        END

        example:
        Type command:
            stats hotkey 2
        Result:    
            HOTKEY_UPDATE
            127.0.0.1  42  U3Ronx4T2lrZBmRNxwqWOrajeORzae4YFZe1FL1pYfU26v6ujM
            127.0.0.47 18  5m0iv4W9oajcGB7FnWONZ1QRVHRkzz7dIHfOHs1zDqFEXkgsw7
            END 
    
     Return ERROR for unexpect input. 
    
* stats hotclient
    stats hotclient [ntop]
   
    Return ntop most hot client of Memcached.
    ntop is the number to be shown, and ntop <= max_hot_client(1024).
   
    Result format:
        HOTCLIENT
        refcount ip
        ...
        refcount ip
        END

        example:
        Type command:
            stats hotclient 2
        Result:
            HOTCLIENT
            11994 127.10.13.1
            1781 127.10.3.15
            END

     Return ERROR for unexpect input.  

* schooner hotkey reset
    
    Reset hotkey in Memcached.
    Return OK if successful, or else return ERROR.

    
3. Snapshot viewer for history hot key.
    hotkey_viewer utility provides this feature supporting,
    which is in /opt/schooner/memcached/bin.
    
    1). basic usage of hotkey_viewer
    a) To viewer hot key in history:
    perl hotkey_viewer
    b) To viewer hot client in history:
    perl hotkey_viewer --hotclient

    2). advanced usage of hotkey_viewer
    For advanced usage of hotkey_viewer, such as ntop, history, client_ip, operation:
    ./hotkey_viewer [-hotclient] [-ntop NTOP] [-history NHOUR] [-ip IP] [-op OP] [-d] [-h]
        by default:
            NTOP=100
            NHOUR=7d
            IP=0(return all clients)
            OP=update
        a) hotclient is assential for determing to view hot key or hot client.
        b) nhour should be h/d(hour/day) format, ex: 20h, 5d
        c) ip should be address ip format with "xxx.xxx.xxxx.xxx", ex: 172.16.13.26
        d) op should be update/get/access.
        e) -d is for debug
        f) if hotclient option is specified, then ntop hot client is counted,
           else hot keys are counted. For hot client, ip and op have no meaning any more.

        example:
            To get hot clients in 5 hours:
            ./hotkey_viewer -hotclient -ntop 100 -history 5h 

            To get hot keys in 30 days with ip 172.16.13.26 and op is UPDATE
            ./hotkey_viewer -ntop 200 -history 30d -ip 172.16.13.26 -op update


4. Advanced usage of hot key for configuration
    This part is expected for admin user of Memcached. Don't change any default configuration
    unless you are sure that you are very familiar with these configuratin, else it may crash
    Memcached product.

    1) To start/stop/restart/status hotkey service:
    sudo /sbin/service hotkey start/stop/restart/status
    
    If you want to modify hotkey service instead of default parameters, 
    please refer to /user/bin/hotkey.pl script.

    2) Snapshots are dumped in /opt/schooner/hotkey/ with 1 hour interval and save maximal
    8G space for snapshots.
 
    3) To view hotkey service log:
      log are saved in /var/log/schooner/hotkey.log, 
      and logrotate configure file is /etc/logrotate.d/hotkey_logrotate
