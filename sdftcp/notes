Fix
    * Guojing should free up send buffers in send_cleanup.
    * Get rid of NTOH_COPY and HTON_COPY which call abort.
    * It seems that node_alloc gets a fixed size storage for name.  This should
      be fixed.
    * Problems if broadcast socket is non-blocking.
    * Fix race condition in SDF message when starting up
    * May not work with more than two nodes
    * Debug printing checksum and data
    * Ensure that write error on socket causes node drop and proper recovery.
    * Write bandwidth program.
    * Write program to send data to many nodes


TO DO
-----
[ ] valgind

[ ] Test with many machines and many instances per machine.

[ ] Randomize order of sending messages.
    That is, do not always send to other nodes in order of rank.

[ ] After select(), if more than one fd is readable, remember the
    set of fds that were ready but are not being serviced this time.
    On the next select(), service fds that were ready earlier, before
    servicing fds that have just now become ready.  Rationale:
    We do not want to favor the lower numbered fds.  To the extent
    possible, it is desirable to handle requests, in order.

[ ] free MSGQ when taking a message off of a queue.
    Keep small pool of MSGQs, 32 elements with 32-bit bitmap.

[ ] cleanup() function: close file descriptors; free memory.

[ ] Run test using multilog, or perhaps emacs, 1 buffer per instance.

[ ] Add @gdb annotations and convert them to gdb command file.

[ ] Some messages contain binary data.  Use cat -v and/or hexdump()
    to show that data, if needed.

[ ] Dust off hex_dump().

[ ] Dust off streval().
