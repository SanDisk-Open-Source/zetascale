LEGAL  ENTITY REPRESENTED  BY THE  INDIVIDUAL ENTERING  THIS AGREEMENT
(“LICENSEE”)  THE  TERMS  AND  CONDITIONS  OF  THE  END  USER  LICENSE
AGREEMENT (“EULA” OR “AGREEMENT”) SET FORTH BELOW. IF LICENSEE ACCEPTS
THE TERMS, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL CONSTITUTE A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN
LICENSEE AND SANDISK. LICENSEE MAY ACCEPT THE OFFER TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY CLICKING “ACCEPT” OR  BY DOWNLOADING, USING OR INSTALLING
THE SOFTWARE.  THIS AGREEMENT GOVERNS LICENSEE’S LICENSE GRANT FOR THE
“SOFTWARE” (AS DEFINED BELOW). LICENSEE MUST ACQUIRE THE LICENSE GRANT
SEPARATELY FROM THIS  END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT.  LICENSEE SHOULD NOT
DOWNLOAD,  INSTALL OR  OTHERWISE USE  THE  SOFTWARE IN  ANY WAY  UNTIL
LICENSEE HAS CAREFULLY  READ THE TERMS OF THIS  AGREEMENT. IF LICENSEE
DOES NOT  ACCEPT THIS  AGREEMENT (AND  AGREE TO ALL  ITS TERMS)  OR IF
LICENSEE  HAS  NOT  ACQUIRED  A  LICENSE  GRANT  FROM  SANDISK  OR  AN
AUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY,  LICENSEE SHOULD NOT DOWNLOAD,  INSTALL OR USE
THE SOFTWARE.

1. Software.

a.  The   software  programs,   device  drivers,  data   and/or  other
information delivered to Licensee  and associated with this Agreement,
together with any bug fixes and/or  Updates (as defined in the Support
Services Policy  available from SanDisk  or an Authorized  Third Party
(collectively “Software”)) is provided to  Licensee under the terms of
this Agreement. This  Agreement incorporates the terms  of the SanDisk
order acknowledgement.  The Software  is owned  by SanDisk  and/or its
third  party licensors  (“Licensors”).  The Software  is protected  by
copyright laws and international copyright  treaties, as well as other
intellectual property laws and treaties.

b. Except as  provided herein or in a separate  contract with SanDisk,
Licensee  is responsible  for  supplying all  hardware, software,  and
services necessary to use the  Software. Licensee is fully responsible
for training Licensee’s  personnel to use the  Software. SanDisk shall
have no  training obligations unless  Licensee enters into  a separate
written  contract with  SanDisk  (or an  Authorized  Third Party)  for
installation   and/or   training   services.  Licensee   may   request
professional  services from  SanDisk associated  with this  Agreement,
which shall  be offered  in SanDisk’s sole  discretion subject  to the
terms and conditions of a separate written agreement agreed to by both
parties.

2. License Grant.

a. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein (including the
License Grant restrictions  in Section 3 below)  and Licensee’s timely
payment of all  Software licensing fees, SanDisk grants  to Licensee a
limited,  non-exclusive,  non-sublicensable,  non-transferable,  right
under SanDisk’s  intellectual property rights  to install and  use the
Software  in  executable  form  solely  for  the  Licensee’s  business
purpose(s) as identified  in the documentation for  the licensed grant
purchased by Licensee (the "License  Grant"). The Software is “in use”
when it  is either  downloaded, copied, loaded  into RAM  or installed
into the hard disk or  other permanent memory of Licensee’s designated
server. Only  one instance  of the  Software may  be used  per License
Grant and  Licensee must uninstall  deactivated instances. The  use of
simultaneous  instances requires  the purchase  of additional  License
Grants by Licensee.

b.  Notwithstanding anything  to the  contrary in  this Agreement,  if
Licensee is using the Software under an evaluation License Grant, then
such  Software  (“Evaluation  Deliverables”) is  provided  solely  for
internal testing for  suitability for use in  a commercial environment
(the “Evaluation Purpose”), solely at the site identified by Evaluator
to  SanDisk   during  download   (“Approved  Site”).   The  Evaluation
Deliverables  are NOT  FOR PRODUCTION  USE,  and no  implied right  is
granted in  connection with  such evaluation. For  a period  of thirty
(30)  days  following  the  delivery of  the  Evaluation  Deliverables
(“Evaluation Period”), SanDisk hereby grants a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferable,  non-sublicenseable,  revocable  right  to  use  the
Evaluation  Deliverables  solely for  the  Evaluation  Purpose at  the
Approved Site. Title to all  Evaluation Deliverables shall remain with
SanDisk at  all times and  SanDisk reserves its  intellectual property
rights.

c. Subject to  Sections 2 and 3 of this  Agreement, Licensee may allow
its Affiliates, agents and contractors  to use the Software under this
Agreement    solely   in    furtherance    of   Licensee’s    business
purposes. “Affiliate”  means, with respect to  any entity Controlling,
Controlled by,  or under  common Control with  a Party.  “Control,” as
used  in this  definition, means  more than  50% of  the ownership  of
voting shares,  by contract, or otherwise;  but in any such  case: (a)
such entity shall  be deemed to be  an Affiliate only so  long as such
Control exists, and  (b) such entities that would be  considered to be
under Control solely  as a result of being controlled  by a government
of any sovereign country are hereby excluded.

3. License Grant Restrictions.

a. If Licensee breaches a material  term in this Agreement and/or uses
(or allows the use of) the  Software in a manner not expressly allowed
by this Agreement, and fails to  correct the breach within thirty (30)
days  of notice,  then Licensee  is in  default of  the Agreement  and
SanDisk may, at its option, terminate Licensee’s License Grant.

b. Licensee acknowledges and agrees  that the Software is licensed and
not sold. Except  for the rights in the Software  expressly granted to
Licensee, SanDisk  and its  Licensors reserve  and retain  all rights,
title, and interest  in and to the Software,  any derivatives thereto,
and  any   corresponding  intellectual  property   (including  without
limitation any  images, and text  incorporated into the  Software, any
accompanying materials, and any copies  of the Software). In addition,
SanDisk  retains  ownership  of  the   means  and  technology  of  (i)
installation  and  (ii)  testing  of the  Software.  Licensee  is  not
allowed,  absent SanDisk’s  prior  written authorization,  to copy  or
otherwise reproduce the  Software, nor to install or  use the Software
on any server,  computer or like device except the  server at the site
Licensee  designated  during  the   downloading  process.  No  implied
licenses are granted to Licensee.

c. The Software may incorporate third party software licensed under an
open  source  license  (“Open  Source  Software”).  Such  Open  Source
Software  is licensed  to Licensee  under terms  provided by  the Open
Source Software  Licensors and  not the terms  of this  Agreement, and
Licensee  agrees   to  the   terms  of   such  Open   Source  Software
licenses.  Licensee  may  not   modify,  adapt,  translate  or  create
derivative  works  (e.g. new  versions)  of  the Software,  except  as
expressly permitted  by any  applicable licenses  with respect  to any
Open Source Software  components of the Software.  Except as expressly
required by  licenses of  any Open Source  Software components  of the
Software (if any), no source code is provided under this Agreement.

d. To  the extent enforceable  by law,  Licensee shall not,  nor shall
Licensee  allow any  other  party to,  reverse engineer,  disassemble,
decompile,  rent, lease,  or encumber  the Software,  or re-create  or
discover the  source code of the  Software. Licensee may not  embed or
combine  the  Software  within  any other  software  product  nor  any
unapproved  device.  Licensee’s  exercise  of any  rights  granted  to
Licensee under this Agreement shall be at Licensee’s sole expense.

e. Licensee  may not sell,  transfer, relicense, or  otherwise provide
the Software (or any portion  thereof), including by operation of law,
to any  third parties  or permit  third parties to  access or  use the
Software.  Licensee  agrees  that  the  Software  is  proprietary  and
confidential information of SanDisk  and its Licensors, which Licensee
shall  strictly  protect  from unauthorized  dissemination  internally
and/or disclosure  to third parties.  Licensee shall not  separate the
Software into component  parts for sublicense, sharing,  or other form
of transfer to a third party, or otherwise make the Software available
in  any manner  to any  third  party for  independent use  in a  third
party’s business operations.

f. Licensee agrees not to remove  and to retain any copyright notices,
licensing statements or list of disclaimers included with the Software
with regard  to each copy of  the Software Licensee receives  or makes
subject to the terms of this Agreement.

g. Licensee  shall not, nor shall  Licensee allow any other  party to,
disclose benchmarks  or other performance comparisons  of the Software
without SanDisk’s express prior written consent.

h. Licensee acknowledges that SanDisk may be irreparably harmed in the
event  of  Licensee’s actual  or  threatened  violation of  Licensee’s
obligations hereunder and that in  addition to other remedies to which
it  may be  entitled, SanDisk  shall  be entitled  to seek  injunctive
relief  or any  appropriate  decree of  specific  performance for  any
actual or threatened violations or breach by or on Licensee’s behalf.

i. Licensee grants SanDisk and its Licensors a worldwide, irrevocable,
perpetual,  transferable,  royalty-free   right  to  use,  sublicense,
distribute   and   modify   any   feedback   (including   information,
suggestions,  ideas  or  comments)  provided by  Licensee  to  SanDisk
regarding the Software.

4. Support Services.

If Licensee  has purchased support  services with the  Software, these
services  will be  provided  to Licensee  under  the Support  Services
Policy (“Policy”) available at such  URL as SanDisk may designate. The
Policy may be  revised from time to time by  SanDisk in SanDisk’s sole
discretion. The Policy in effect at  the time the support services are
delivered shall  govern the terms  of SanDisk’s support  services. The
term  for  support services  under  this  Policy shall  commence  upon
delivery of the Software or, if  such support services are not ordered
with  the Software,  on the  effective  date of  the support  services
contract as mutually agreed by  Licensee and SanDisk. Any supplemental
or  updated materials  provided to  Licensee  as part  of the  support
services are considered part of the  Software and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement or other agreement that is applied to
such updates.  Payment of fees  for support services does  not entitle
Licensee to obtain rights to use  or have access to any subsequent new
versions  or  upgrades  to  the Software;  Licensee  is  obligated  to
purchase such rights separately if  Licensee wishes to install and use
such new versions.

5. Delivery and Access.

a. Licensee  is fully responsible  for downloading and  installing the
Software. Delivery  may be accomplished  by SanDisk (or  an Authorized
Third Party)  (a) by electronically transmitting  Software to Licensee
or (b)  by making Software available  for download by Licensee  from a
protected download  site such as an  FTP site. The method  of delivery
will be  at SanDisk’s option, as  noted on its order  confirmation. If
the  order confirmation  is silent  on delivery,  then subsection  (b)
above  applies. Licensee  consents to  electronic transmission  of the
unique device identifier (UDID) of its  host device to SanDisk for the
purpose of  identification and authentication  of the host  device and
for other purposes  that may be necessary to  complete the transaction
(including  sharing  such  UDID  with an  Authorized  Third  Party  if
applicable) and  to provide information  and services relating  to the
transaction.   Licensee  acknowledges   that   the  availability   and
performance of  the Software may  be subject to interruption  or delay
due to causes beyond the reasonable control of SanDisk.

b. SanDisk  will invoice upon  delivery of  the Software to  either an
Authorized  Third   Party  or  Licensee.  Except   as  required  under
applicable law or under Licensee’s fully signed written agreement with
SanDisk or  an Authorized Third  Party, Licensee is  fully responsible
for payment  of all taxes, without  reduction of any fees,  charges or
expenses paid by  Licensee or received by SanDisk with  respect to the
Software,  including  without  limitation  sales,  use,  value  added,
withholding or  similar taxes,  (excluding taxes based  upon SanDisk’s
net income).

6. Records and Compliance.

Audit  Rights Licensee  shall maintain  complete, clear,  and accurate
records  of: (a)  the location  and use  of each  copy and/or  running
instance of the  Software; and (b) any other information  which may be
reasonably  requested  by SanDisk  to  determine  whether Licensee  is
paying correct fees and/or complying  with the terms of this Agreement
and  shall  provide certified  copies  of  such records  at  SanDisk’s
request. SanDisk or its representatives shall have the right, upon ten
(10) days’ written notice, during Licensee’s normal business hours, to
examine and  audit Licensee’s  books, records, computing  devices, and
operations  to  verify  Licensee’s  compliance  with  applicable  law,
regulations,  standards  organizations  and/or  this  Agreement.  Such
examination or audit  may be performed, in  SanDisk’s sole discretion,
onsite at Licensee’s  premises or through remote  access to Licensee’s
systems. If  any such  examination discloses  unpaid license  or other
fees, Licensee shall reimburse SanDisk for the full amount of any such
unpaid license or  other fees plus interest at the  rate of the lesser
of twelve  percent (12%) per annum  or the maximum rate  allowed under
applicable law. Moreover,  in the event the  inspection or examination
reveals  a violation  of  applicable law,  regulations and/or  License
Grant  restrictions under  this  Agreement,  Licensee shall  reimburse
SanDisk  for the  actual  reasonable costs  and  expenses incurred  in
connection with such onsite or remote operations audit.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.

TO THE  MAXIMUM EXTENT  PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE  LAW, THE  SOFTWARE IS
PROVIDED “AS  IS” AND  “AS AVAILABLE” WITH  NO WARRANTIES  AND NEITHER
SANDISK  NOR  ITS  LICENSORS  MAKE  ANY  REPRESENTATION  OR  WARRANTY,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, IN LAW OR  FROM THE COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE
OF  TRADE,  EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED, INCLUDING  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  ANY
WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY,  FITNESS FOR  A  PARTICULAR  PURPOSE,
NON-INTERFERENCE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF  ANY THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY   RIGHTS,   OR   EQUIVALENTS    UNDER   THE   LAWS   OF   ANY
JURISDICTION. SANDISK  DOES NOT  WARRANT THAT  THE SOFTWARE  WILL MEET
LICENSEE’S  REQUIREMENTS OR  THAT OPERATION  OF THE  SOFTWARE WILL  BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR  ERROR FREE. LICENSEE  ASSUMES THE ENTIRE RISK  AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE, UNLESS LICENSEE  IS CURRENT ON SUPPORT,  THEN LICENSEE, AND
NOT SANDISK  (NOR SANDISK’S LICENSORS  OR AUTHORIZED THIRD  PARTIES IF
APPLICABLE), ASSUMES  THE ENTIRE COST OF  NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR,
OR CORRECTION.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

TO THE EXTENT NOT  PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT  WILL SANDISK OR ITS
LICENSORS,  NOR  THEIR   RESPECTIVE  DIRECTORS,  OFFICERS,  EMPLOYEES,
CONSULTANTS,  LICENSORS, LICENSEES  OR AFFILIATES,  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY
INDIRECT,  INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,  CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE  OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES,  ARISING  OUT   OF  OR  IN  CONNECTION   WITH  THE  DOWNLOAD,
DISTRIBUTION, USE  OR PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE  OF THE SOFTWARE,
EVEN  IF  SANDISK  HAS  BEEN   ADVISED  OF  THE  POSSIBILITY  OF  SUCH
DAMAGES. IF LICENSEE IS DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE,
OR WITH ANY  OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, LICENSEE’S  SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SOFTWARE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS
OF LIABILITY  SHALL APPLY  NOTWITHSTANDING ANY  FAILURE OF  ANY REMEDY
PROVIDED  FOR HEREUNDER  IN ITS  ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  IN NO  EVENT WILL
SANDISK’S OR  ITS LICENSORS’  TOTAL LIABILITY  TO LICENSEE  EXCEED THE
FEES PAID BY  LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE. THE ABOVE  LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY IN  CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS  WHICH PROHIBIT EXCLUDING  OR LIMITING
LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

and  conditions  of this  Agreement,  as  applicable. If  Licensee  is
permitted under  this Agreement  to provide Software  or documentation
and/or related items and technology  to any third party, including any
agency of the  U.S, or any state and local  government, Licensee shall
include  the legend  set forth  above in  any agreement  governing the
provision   of   such    items.   As   used   in    FAR   and   DFARS,

IF LICENSEE  REQUIRES TAA-COMPLIANT  PRODUCTS, IT SHALL  DISCLOSE THIS
REQUIREMENT TO SANDISK, IN WRITING, AT THE TIME OF THE SOLICITATION OR
REQUEST   FOR   A   QUOTE,   AND  SHALL   OBTAIN   SEPARATE,   WRITTEN
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT   FROM  SANDISK   OF  THE   SAME.  ALL   ORDERS  SHALL
CONSPICUOUSLY REFERENCE ANY REQUIREMENT  FOR TAA-COMPLIANT PRODUCT. If
Licensee fails to  comply with the preceding  sentences (including, if
SanDisk makes  no acknowledgement of the  TAA-compliance requirement),
SanDisk  shall  have  no  liability  for  providing  non-TAA-compliant
software, documentation, or related services.

10. Assignment.

Licensee may not assign or transfer  this Agreement (by contract or by
operation of  law) or  any licenses acquired  under this  agreement in
part or in  whole without SanDisk’s prior consent, and  any attempt to
do so  shall be null and  void. SanDisk may freely  assign or delegate

damage  (collectively,  “High  Risk   Activities”).  SANDISK  AND  ITS
LICENSORS DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH
RISK ACTIVITIES AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY LIABILITIES
OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM SUCH USE.

13. Segmentation.

The purchase of any License Grant is separate from any other order for
any other SanDisk products, support and related services that Licensee
may receive or has received  from SanDisk.Licensee’s obligation to pay
for the License  Grant is not contingent on performance  of support or
any other  services or delivery of  any other SanDisk products  or (b)
support  is not  contingent on  delivery  of any  SanDisk products  or
performance of any additional/other services.

14. General.

actively restrict SanDisk’s access to any protected health information
in Licensee’s possession. This Agreement (together with other existing
agreements,  if any  between Licensee  and SanDisk  (or an  Authorized
Third  Party)  associated  with  the  Software)  contains  the  entire
understanding between the parties  with respect to Licensee’s purchase
of a License Grant, installation and  use of the Software. If any part
of this Agreement is found void  and unenforceable, it will not affect
the  validity of  the balance  of this  Agreement, which  shall remain

governed by and  construed under the laws of the  State of California,
USA and  controlling U.S. federal  law without regard to  conflicts of
laws  provisions thereof.  The U.N.  Convention on  Contracts for  the
International Sale  of Goods  shall not apply  to this  Agreement. Any
action or proceeding arising from  or relating to this Agreement shall
be adjudicated in  the state or federal courts of  Santa Clara County,
California,  USA,  and  the  parties hereby  agree  to  the  exclusive
jurisdiction and  venue of such  courts. Licensee shall not  remove or
export from the  United States or re-export from anywhere  any part of
the Software or any direct product thereof to any country in violation

under  applicable  export  laws  and  regulations  including,  without
limitation, those of  the U.S. Department of  Commerce. Licensee shall
be responsible for compliance with applicable laws for Licensee’s (and

effective   only   if   made   using  a   mechanism   preapproved   by
SanDisk. Licensee agrees  that the Licensors, if any,  are third party
beneficiaries of  this Agreement to enforce  Licensee’s performance of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The provisions of Sections
1,  3, 4,  6, 7,  8,  9, 10,  11, 12,  13,  and 14  shall survive  the
